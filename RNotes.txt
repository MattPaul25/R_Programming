R brief history: 
R is a dialect of S
	S is a language developed by John Chambers at Bell Labs in 1976 
		Implemented as a series of fourtran libraries - early forms didnt contain statistical models
		In 1988 it was rewritten in the C language - Version 3
		Version 4 (was developed in 1988) 

		Bell Labs gave STat SCi - an exclusive license to dev and sell the S language

		ub 04 Inishgt ful purchased S language from Lucent for 2m

		S language still exst as S-plus

	S philosophy
		Wanted to create an interactive environment - where you are not thinking about programming
		Use the environment without knowing about any sort of programming
		Use it to look at data and do analysis
		System promotes transition from user to programmer


Back to R - 91 created in NZ by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentlemen 
			93 it was first announced to the public
			95 use GNU General Public License to make R free software
			96 A public mailing list is created (r-help and r-devel)
			97 R core group is formed
			2000 R version 1 is released
			13 R version 3.0.2 released

	R features:
			Semantics are similar to S - but its quite different
			Runs on any OS (even ps3?)
			Core software is lean... 
			Strong graphics capabilities - 
			R is free (free beer, and free speech)
				Free software 4 principles
					Freedom to run the program for any purpose freedom0
					Freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs freedom0
					Freedom to redistribute copies to your neighbors freedom2
					Freedom to improve the program and release them to the public

	R Drawbacks
			1 Based on 40 year old technology
			2 Little support for dynamic or 3d graphics
			3 functionality is based on consumer demands and user contributions
			4 Objects must generally be stored on physical memory, but there have been advancements
			5 Not ideal for all possible situations 
	
	Design of R system
			Base R system you download from CRAN
			The base system include utils stats datasets graphics grdevices grid methods tools parallel compiler splines tcltk stats4
			Revommended packages (boot, class, cluster, codetools, foreign, KernSmooth, lattice, mgcv, rpart, survival, MASS, spatial, nnet, matrix)

			CRAN has 4k packages that have been developed by users and programmers around the world


	R resources on CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org)
			Intro to R
			Writing R extensions
			R data import/exports
			R import
